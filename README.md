# Horus Rescheduling Web Application

Hello! We are group 27 and we are proud to present our approach on the Class Rescheduling Project.

## Getting Started

The application runs alongside Tomcat which will require to setup the servlet environment. Our main working environment was IntelliJ which already had a Tomcat Deployment
utility.

### Prerequisites

Any Tomcat utility able to setup the server.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

Step 1) Setup the Maven dependencies.
```
This was not required in IntelliJ, but Eclipse might require it.
```

Step 2) Setup the Apache Tomcat server.
```
We tested and advice on using port :8080.
```

Step 3) Setup JRE
```
Default version: 1.8.
```
